The general idea was to first store the script into a buffer which would then be parsed into a linked list of command tokens.
From the linked list of command tokens, we stripped all the white space and unnecessary newlines. We checked the syntax by creating
the function grammarCheck() which traversed the linked list of tokens and checked for any malformed syntax. If there was a syntax error,
the program would exit and return the line number as desired in the spec. We then created an io_redirect function to parse the linked list
into a set of commands that could then be sent through out algorithm to print out the desired tree.

Issues we ran into:
We used the fprintf function to print information into stderr for debugging purposes. We didn't realize that this would cause the test cases to fail
until several hours of attempting to debug it. Once we commented out all the debugging fprintf statements, we passed all the test cases swimmingly.
